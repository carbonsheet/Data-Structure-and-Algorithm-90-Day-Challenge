# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm-90-Day-Challenge
The challenge will cover various topics, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, searching, sorting, and dynamic programming. Each week, participants will be given a set of exercises to complete, along with resources and tutorials to help them understand the concepts covered.

### The program will be structured as follows:

- Week 1-2: Introduction to data structures and algorithms, arrays, and linked lists
- Week 3-4: Stacks, queues, and trees
- Week 5-6: Graphs and searching algorithms
- Week 7-8: Sorting algorithms and dynamic programming
- Week 9-10: Advanced data structures and algorithms
- Week 11-12: Project week, where participants will work on a real-world project using the concepts learned during the challenge.
